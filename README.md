Hotels in Mumbai
Overview
"Hotels in Mumbai" is an Android application designed to help users discover and book food options at hotels throughout Mumbai.
Developed as part of my mobile computing course, this app serves as a foundation for enhancing user experiences in hotel dining. 
It features a data-saving capability that allows users to store their preferences locally on their devices and sync this information with a web application via a defined API. 
This functionality aims to provide effective and impactful solutions for both users and hotel management.
Additionally, this was a CRUD Application where you could add, read, update, and delete food on and from the list.
